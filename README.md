CODSOFT Internship repository.
Hello, my name is Granth Gupta and this is 'codsoft' repository especially designed for codsoft internship project task.
1.) I have tried to complete the given task within the timelimit of project submission.
2.) I tried to complete the given task by myself, but wherever i stucked i took help from mdn docks, stack overflow and w3 school.
3.) I thoroughly enjoyed coding with codsoft's java programming internship and some of the task given were a little bit challenging as a new learner of Java language.
4.) I wish to have more projects with codsoft.

Task 1 Number Guessing Game
-> Random generating number between (50-100) which allows user to guess the number within 9 max attempts.
-> Random number should not be less or higher then 'min' and 'max' range, otherwise it will give an error message.
-> Once successfully generated the code will conclude and ask the user to play again or not.
-> If user is unable to get the random after max attempts then the correct Random number will be displayed accordingly.

Task 2 Student Grade Calculator
-> Here user needs to enter the no. of subjects in which he gained marks.
-> Once the user enters the no. of subjects the user will be prompted to entered the marks he/she scored in all the total subject.
-> Based on the marks obtained the user will get the average (%) he/she gets and according to the average percentage he/she will be awareded grades which will conclude if they failed or passed the exam.
-> Next they will be prompted to enter other students's marks..

Task 3 ATM Machine
-> user will be given 4 options as an atm menu where he/she can deposit, withdraw, check bank balance or exit the menu.
-> Initial Balance will be â‚¹200.00 and the user can deposit, withdraw or check the balance by updating it.
-> All the Withdraw and Deposit amount will be stored in public class name "BankAccount.java".
-> All the menu options wil be stored in public class named "ATM.java"
-> Both of the classes will me merged in main class so they works accordingly.
-> All the 3 classes must be complied together and run..

To compile and run the java code...

To compile the code, you must run it on terminal by typing the following code:-
javac 'classnamae##.java'

To run he same java code:-
java 'classname##'

Note:- All the java files related to same project shall be stored in the same directory/folder in order to run the code errorfree...

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide internship experiance for java programming. ðŸ˜Š
I learned a lot from these projects and of course got some new skills to try.
